                <h2>Welcome to My Portfolio!</h2>
                <p>
                    I’m a passionate junior developer currently completing my Associate’s Degree in Computer Information Systems and Computer Programming.
                    With hands-on experience in C#, C++, Java, and Python, I enjoy building interactive applications and games.
                    I have practical experience using Unity and Unreal Engine, developing projects that sharpen my programming skills and creativity.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Beyond coding, I am enthusiastic about learning new technologies like Blender for 3D modeling and continuously improving my abilities to bring engaging digital experiences to life.
                    I’m driven by problem-solving and love working on projects that challenge me to grow as a developer.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This portfolio showcases some of my favorite projects, from web-based games to Unity-powered classics.
                    I’m excited to connect, collaborate, and contribute to innovative tech teams. So welcome to my portfolio!
